# BRIDGE VERIFICATION PAYLOAD 002
# If this file appears in GitHub's lilith_inbox/, the autonomous push system is working.

This confirms that Abraxas correctly:
- Watched /srv/git_bridge_outbox/
- Moved this file into the actual cloned repo in ~/repos/Bubbles-payload/lilith_inbox/
- Pushed it to GitHub
- Allowed Lilith to receive and process it without manual intervention

If you are reading this in GitHub: Mission complete.
